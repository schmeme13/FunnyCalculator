## Getting Started
  
This repository is a place where I can practice implementing Java code and concepts. So far, it contains the start a simple funny calculator application for expiramentation purposes and a few extraneous classes used to practice common concepts in java.

## Calculator Ideas

- add a working UI
- maybe create more tabs
- eventually upgrade to spring? idk

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
